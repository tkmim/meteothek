# meteothek
--

"meteothek" is an easy-to-use cartopy/matplotlib wrapper for meteorological 2D visualisation.


"meteothek" is a small personal project to make a map-making toolkit used in my research works, which provides the fastest way to have a quick look of geographical numpy 2D arrays and has consistent optional keywords. It is unnecessary for users to understand the technical details of colormap, boundarynorm, label formats, etc... 


## Prerequirement 
- matplotlib
- cartopy (> 0.18.0)

## Usage
```python
from meteothek import draw, util, proj
```
